# UKroadaccidentPowerBI
I have worked on a United Kingdom road accident dataset, using PowerBI to clean the data by addressing missing values and duplicates. 
Afterward, created new metrics to compare accident and injury data between 2021 and 2022, identify the most common vehicle types involved, analyze injury severity differences, examine weather conditions, and consider the presence of roads and intersections. The main goal of this dashboard is to gain insights into road accidents, particularly focusing on casualty counts based on accident severity, vehicle types, road surfaces, and related factors.

Steps performed in this project:
•	Requirement gathering: Wants to create a United Kingdom road accident dashboard for year 2021-2022 so that we have insights on below:
	Primary KPI:- 
o	Total casualties and total accident values for current year and YOY growth
o	Total causalities by accident severity for current year and YOY growth
	Secondary KPI:- 
o	Total causalities with respect to vehicle type for current year
	Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year
	Casualties by Road Type of Current year
	Current year causalities by area/location and day/night
	Total casualties and total accident by location 
•	Raw data overview
•	Connect data with Power BI
•	Data Cleaning
•	Data Processing (DAX, power pivot query)
•	Data Modelling 
•	Data visualization
•	Dashboard building 
•	Insights

Who can use this dashboard / List of stakeholders:
	Ministry of Transport
	Road Transport Department
	Police Force
	Emergency Services Department
	Road Safety Corps
	Transport Operators
